# vim-dotfiles

### Configuration, plugins, dot files that I use to setup my vim 

## Prerequisites
- This is for *nix OS, linux, macos, etc.
- vim version 8.1+
It must have the +conceal option compiled, this is needed for one of the
plugins I'm using (keep reading) 

## Installation
- I use vim plugins, so the first step is to install a plug-in manager, there are several 
plug-in managersbut I've chosen to use [this one](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- create directory ~/.vim
- copy ~/.vim/mappings.vim into the same location in your local filesystem.
- copy ~/.vimrc into the same location in your filesystem.
- launch vim, the issue command ':PlugIntall', this a command from vim-plug
