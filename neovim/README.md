# vim-dotfiles

### Configuration, plugins, dot files that I use to setup my vim 

## Prerequisites
Altough this will most lilkely work with vim, this is tailored for [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

I've tested this with: 
* Neovim 0.4.4
Installed here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.4.4

## Installation
I am using vim plugins, so the first step is to install a plug-in manager, there are several 
plug-in managers; I've chosen to use [this one](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* create directories '~/.config/nvim/', '~/.config/nvim/undodir'
* copy init.vim, mappings.vim, hotkeys,vim and defaults.vim to it.
* launch vim, the issue command ':PlugIntall' to install all plugins.
